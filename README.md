# RSA Algorithm

RSA-Algorithm application was written in C Programming language by using "graphics.h" library.

In this application, random prime numbers between 100 and 150 and likewise a random message between 0 and 100 were determined, and both encryption and decryption were performed in the application. In terms of determining prime numbers and encrypting the message to be transmitted, the initiative is left to the user and codes can be edited in a C compiler.
